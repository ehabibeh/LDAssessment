# LDAssessment
LoanDepot Assessment

Hello Team,

I've provided multiple solutions for this assesment:

Hello_World_GetDuplicateChar: Provides the first duplicate character in the string "Hello World".
Read-Host_GetDuplicateChar: Provides the first duplicate character in a given string from command-line.
InputBox_GetDuplicateChar: Provides the first duplicate character in a given string using the default VisualBasic GUI.
Get-DuplicateChar: "Get-DuplicateChar" Cmdlet.

I hope I didn't overdue it, but I enjoyed working on this. I look forward to hearing back from you. I'm still currently on vacation, but will keep my eye on my emails. Feel free to contact me any time. I'll be back from vacation by Thursday night.

Thank you!
